Assigment 1  
========================================================

This is a R markdown in my computer for assigment 1

Loading and preprocessing the data

``` {r}
Data_Raw <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE)
Data_Clean <- Data_Raw[which(Data_Raw$steps != "NA"), ]
library(plyr)
Data_day <- ddply(Data_Clean, .(date), summarise, steps=sum(steps))
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

a. Histogram of Steps per day

```{r}
hist(Data_day$steps, main="Number of Steps", 
     xlab="Total number of steps taken each day", col="blue")
```

b. Calculation of the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(Data_day$steps)
median(Data_day$steps)
```

What is the average daily activity pattern?

a. A time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r} 
Average_interval <- ddply(Data_Clean, .(interval), summarise, steps=mean(steps))
plot(Average_interval$interval, Average_interval$steps, type="l", 
     col="Black",
     xlab="5-minute Interval", 
     ylab="Average Number of Steps Taken",
     main="Pattern of Average Activity per Day")

```

b. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?


```{r}
Average_interval[Average_interval$steps==max(Average_interval$steps),]
```

Imputing missing values

a. Reporting total number of missing values in the dataset 

```{r}
sum(is.na(Data_Raw$steps))

```

b. Filling  all of the missing values in the dataset. We fill the values with the avarage of the values presented.

```{r}

colnames(Average_interval)[2] <- "Avg_interval"

Data_missfill <- arrange(join(Data_Raw, Average_interval), interval)
```



c. New dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
Data_missfill$steps[is.na(Data_missfill$steps)] <- Data_missfill$Avg_interval[is.na(Data_missfill$steps)]

```

d.1. A histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
New_data_hist <- ddply(Data_missfill, .(date), summarise, steps=sum(steps))
hist(New_data_hist$steps, main="Number of Steps (missing values fill in)", 
     xlab="Total number of steps per day", col="blue",)
```

d.2. Report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(New_data_hist$steps)
median(New_data_hist$steps)
```

d.3. The impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps? (Using sum  as operation of difference)


```{r}
sum_steps_data <- sum(Data_Clean$steps)
sum_steps_data_missfillin  <- sum(Data_missfill$steps)
total_diff <- sum_steps_data_missfillin -sum_steps_data []
total_diff
```

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

a. New factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```{r}
week_day <- weekdays(as.Date(Data_missfill$date))
data_weekday <- transform(Data_missfill, day=weekdays)
data__weekday$week <- ifelse(data_weekday$day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"),"weekend", "weekday")
Average_interval_week <- ddply(data_weekday, .(interval, week), summarise, steps=mean(steps))
```

b. panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was creating using simulated data:

```{r}

library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | wk, data = Average_interval_week, layout = c(1, 2), type="l")

```
